package maybe

// Steps to solve the problem in lesson 3 of the workshop:
// Define a Maybe type that can hold a value of type T or be invalid
// Define a function that returns an invalid Maybe (it can be None, Nothing,  or any other name you prefer).
// Define an OrElse method that returns the value if valid, or a default value if not valid.
// Go to the pkg/pnp/engine/tview package and fix the code that uses the AsciiArt method.
// Remove the AsciiArt method from the Player interface and implement it in each concrete player type instead.

// Happy solving!
